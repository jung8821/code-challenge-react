# Challenge
- Done by: Tae Jung
- email: kwang8821@gmail.com
- Please see my vue.js version of the project as well. https://github.com/jung8821/code-challenge-vue-2

# Notes
- The project asked to filter by Policy Max, but the model data itself did not contain their policy max values.
I have the code commented out for that part of the function so its functionality will not work on the website.
- Port is set to 4000 for the client.
